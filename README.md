I created an interface to create, update, and delete posts (CRUD). I deviated from the requirements in one aspect:
  - I mergerd all parts of the CRUD interface into one route

In the end the navigation bar doesn't actually link anywhere but I didn't remove it because I liked the css behavior I gave it. So it's more of a dummy header to allow for future functionality.
